### Microservices using Flask

This repository is inspired by https://github.com/selikapro/microservices-python, you can check out the video @selikapro made here : https://github.com/selikapro/microservices-python.

I did not want to use kubernetes, I wanted a "light" architecure easy to deploy locally.

This repository is done for practice purposes, a lot of things are to be configured ... and a lot of things are not suited for production ...
